The system manages:

-  Student registration  
-  Meal booking and cancellation  
-  Monthly bill generation  
-  Data persistence  

This project demonstrates **Modular Programming** and **Separate Compilation** in C.

## Modular Architecture

```text

├── main.c
├── auth.c/.h
├── student.c/.h
├── meal.c/.h
├── billing.c/.h
└── file_handler.c/.h
```

## ⚙️ Compilation Instructions

This project uses gcc and a simple Makefile.

## Quick Compilation (Without Makefile)

If you do not want to use a Makefile, you can compile the project using a single gcc command.

Compile all source files:
```bash
gcc *.c -o mess
```

If you want to create object files from all `.c` files, use the following command:
```bash
make

```
Run the program
```bash
./mess
```
 
<h2>💾 Data Persistence</h2>
The system stores data in three files:

auth.txt - admin details (username and passsword)

students.txt – Student details (roll, name, balance)

meal_log.txt – (Logs of meal booking/cancellation)

ℹ️ For simplicity, meal logs are saved textually; per-day meal arrays can be extended later.

<h2>🧮 Billing Logic</h2>
💰 Meal charges:

Breakfast: 20
Lunch: 30
Dinner: 30

<h2>🧪 Demonstrated Programming Concepts</h2>
✔️ Modular Programming

✔️ Separate Compilation

✔️ Header Guards

✔️ Struct-Based Data Modeling

✔️ File Handling (Text-based Persistence)

✔️ Menu-driven CLI Application
